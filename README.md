## Description

CompOnnect is a social media platform designed specifically for businesses. It allows businesses to create a private network for their employees, where they can share information, collaborate on projects, and stay in touch with each other.
As the owner of a CompOnnect account, you can create a profile for your business and add your employees as users. You can also create roles for your employees, which will help you to organize your company's structure.
Employees can view their own profiles, as well as the profiles of their coworkers. They can also view the roles that they are in, as well as the other employees in those roles.
CompOnnect is a valuable tool for businesses of all sizes. It can help you to improve communication and collaboration, and it can also help you to keep track of your employees' information.
Future implementations of CompOnnect will allow businesses to organize their company as a whole, with files, forms, and more. This will make it even easier for businesses to manage their employees and their work.
Overall, CompOnnect is a powerful tool that can help businesses to improve their efficiency and productivity.

-   Having an announcement board is a great way to keep everyone up to date with the company, so we have implemented a way to post announcements to the company if you are an admin or owner. Employees can still interact however and comment on any of the posts. Giving them a space to voice opinions and engage with the company.

## Future Implementations

-   We would like to implement a way to organize files and forms for the company. This would allow for a more organized way to keep track of important documents. This would also include a way to assign files and forms to employees and keep track of their progress.
-   We would like to implement a way to have a calendar for the company. This would allow for a more organized way to keep track of important dates and events. As well as a way to schedule employees for shifts, meetings, and more.
-   We would like to implement a way to have a task list for the company. This would allow for a more organized way to keep track of important tasks that need to be done. As well as a way to assign tasks to employees and keep track of their progress.
-   We would like to implement a way to have a company directory. This would allow for a more organized way to keep track of important contacts for the company. As well as a way to assign contacts to employees and keep track of their progress.
-   We would like to implement single chats and group chats with specific employees. This would allow for a more organized way to keep track of important conversations and messages. As well as a way to assign messages to employees and keep track of their progress.
-   We will add ways for the owner to create more titles and roles for the employees. This would include a way to choose which roles and titles can do what within the company. (Ex. Permissions)
-   We will add ways for the owner to create departments for the employees.
-   We will add settings for profiles in which employees can change their information and settings. This would include what information they would like to have public and what information they would like to keep private. Which notifications they would like to receive and which notifications they would not like to receive.
-   A way for the owner of the company to edit the company information, such as name, type and logo.
-   A way for owners and admins to add personalized notes to employees profiles, which only they can see. This would include warnings, employee reviews, their current salary, and more.
-   A specialized page for Human Resources, where they can view all of the employees information, as well as their notes. This would have access to whomever is given specific permissions to view it, such as Human Resources role, or added roles to view.
-   Within announcements, we will add a way to add media, files and more to the posts. This would allow for a more organized way to keep track of important documents and media.
-   Validation for forms, so that everything is entered correctly and in the correct format. This will reduce risk of errors and make the application more user friendly.
